Small update to site content. Added section content for CV and about me. 

Also did a minor structure update today to make use of HTML5 layout tags. Replaced major layout tags with equivalent <nav>, <header>, <footer> and <section> elements.

Still TODO:

- Graphics for top banner
- Landing page content
- Styling of code highlight sections
- Update post layout to make use of HTML5 tags
- Consider any other widgets for the right or left panels
- Make sure pagination works on the blog, news and project pages

Progressing slowly but surely. I also still have another blog post to write about devise and omniauth that I intend to do over the next week
