With the new blog post, I found the need to test out pygments as part of jekyll. The code highlighting works great, but I need to seriously
consider the styling. Currently, I'm using [this](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css/blob/master/default.css) default stylesheet from
richleland on github (thanks richleland!) and it works great but doesn't really fit in with the rest of the site.

So my list of things to do has another item on it. The work never stops.
