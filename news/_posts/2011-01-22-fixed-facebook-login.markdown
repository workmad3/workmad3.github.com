title: Fixed Facebook Integration
excerpt: Fixed the integration with facebook and Disqus comments
---
Fairly obviously, the comments login integration with facebook is fixed. This was a simple config setting with Facebook (it helps when using their API keys to set the site's URL).

Also, some minor updates to the layout - the right hand twitter feed has been shunted out a bit more, giving a bit more content space and a more deliberate look to the overhang. This was from some feedback receieved over IRC, 
thanks SpaceGhostC2C :)
