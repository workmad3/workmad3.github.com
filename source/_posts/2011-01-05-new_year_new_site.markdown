Well, I finally decided to get my site sorted out for the new year and the result is what you're seeing in front of you.
<!-- more -->

For those interested in the boring technical details, this new site has been built using the static-site generator Jekyll, and I've styled it with the Blueprint CSS grid framework. 
The colour scheme is one I found that I liked in Kuler, the menu system is one I picked up from a free CSS menu site and I put it all together by hand.

The code and content is also hosted on github [here](http://github.com/workmad3/workmad3.com)

This is all in aid of trying to produce a blog that I'll actually update. My previous attempts are [Shared Illusions](http://sharedillusions.blogspot.com) and [Reflective Coder](http://reflectivecoder.blogspot.com)
and my hypothesis is that now I've moved the blog onto my own domain I'll be more driven to write content for it.

We'll see how that goes :)
