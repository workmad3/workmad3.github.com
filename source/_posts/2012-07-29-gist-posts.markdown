I realised today that most of my contributions to the rails community come in the form of help on the #rubyonrails IRC channel, which frequently ends up with a gist.
This gist ends up in my github account with then no real context in order to understand what formed the code there, leaving isolated snippets that are mostly useless.

So today I put together this thought with my common annoyance of not being able to come up with blog topics and thought 'hey, why don't I blog about the questions from IRC?'

We'll see how it goes over the next few weeks, whether I actually manage to keep up the pace or not :)
