There are many rules and guidelines for programming and they have recently gained a
renewed 'following' that expounds their virtues as things to strive for.

These rules are not things to strive for. These rules are merely ways to achieve the actual
goal. They are easily mistaken for the goal itself though because the attributes that we
actually want in our code make it look like these rules are in play. The reality tends to
be much more post-hoc with rules and guidelines being extracted as patterns from
code that has already been identified as exhibiting desirable attributes.
